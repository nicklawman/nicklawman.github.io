        <h1 id="the-story-behind-this-album">The Story Behind This Album</h1>
        <p>
            In the “Silicon Valley 101” podcast, Mr. Feng mentioned that while
            AI can compose music with technical skill, it can’t instill motive
            and soul, which sets human musicians apart. This insight inspired me
            to merge my creativity with AI, making these songs truly my own.
        </p>
        <p>
            For years, I’ve wanted to create music, but my limited skills kept
            me from turning melodies into something real. In August 2024, I
            finally did it—starting with “Tennessee Sky,” inspired by a road
            trip with my kids. Using songgenerator.io, I shaped my lyrics into
            music, making the first of ten songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, I explored a topic I’ve pondered for years: how to approach
            life after 50. “Me to Me” was born from conversations with ChatGPT,
            creating a light, contrasting song with a deeper message. I then
            delved into religion with “Frozen Monk,” a serious piece about a
            monk’s existential crisis after years of seeking wisdom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Switching gears, I wrote “Stars in Mind,” a passionate, hopeful song
            about humanity’s upcoming space adventures, dedicated to my child.
            Afterward, I created a Christmas song for myself, “Santa, Get Me a
            Ride,” adding a bittersweet twist to my favorite holiday.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also tackled the subject of K-12 math, revealing its secrets in
            “Dragon Code, Math Untold.” Surprisingly, I managed to turn this
            complex idea into a song. Inspired by Yoshimoto Banana’s Amrita, I
            wrote “Unlock It All” for those struggling with depression,
            capturing a moment of healing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reflecting on Steve Jobs’ “connecting the dots” philosophy from his
            Stanford speech, I crafted “Steve’s Dots,” a powerful, rock-infused
            song to set the stage for the final piece. The last song, “Death’s
            Gift,” came to me one morning—imagining a second chance at life
            offered by death due to a small good deed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating this album in a week was a blend of AI’s capabilities and
            my own creative input. It’s not perfect, but these songs are deeply
            personal, written by me, for me. I hope you enjoy them and feel
            inspired to create your own music. Embrace the power of AI and see
            what you can achieve.

            Cherokee land, brave souls reside. Open roads, where dreams arise.
            Mountains sing, stories they hide,<br />Thousand years into
            lullabies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eagles soar, across the divide,<br />Grass fields gather, side by
            side.<br />Follow I-81 the world slides by,<br />From
            Tennessee&#39;s warmth to the morning sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I feel, a spark ignite,<br />Won&#39;t hold back, won&#39;t lose
            the fight.<br />Follow dreams, where clouds do tie, Open my wings,
            and learn to fly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Freeways continue hundred miles,<br />Leading me to where eagles
            vie.<br />Don&#39;t cry, Tennessee, I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll chase
            the sun, hold the skies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, the stars do never lie,<br />I&#39;ll shine my brightest,
            reaching high.<br />For every ending, say a new goodbye,<br />I&#39;ll
            come back, under your southern sky.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I feel, a spark ignite, Won&#39;t hold back, won&#39;t lose the
            fight. Follow dreams, where clouds do tie, Wings open without
            hiding, Move on without doubting, Find my way and truly fly.

    ```markdown
    Verse <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
    As twilight fades, whispers <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> air,
    I feel <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> shift, <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> life laid bare.
    The <span class="hljs-keyword">first</span> act’s done, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> curtain’s drawn,
    Now I greet <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> quiet dawn.
    Memories drift like leaves <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> <span class="hljs-title">wind</span>,
    Some have settled, some rescind.

    Chorus:
    Though <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> years have passed, I stand so free,
    With <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> heart that’s young, I face what’ll be.
    The road may curve, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> night may call,
    But I’ll keep my pace, won’t fear <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> fall.
    The past is light, no chain <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> bind,
    Eyes ahead, <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> fearless mind.

    Bridge:
    Through <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> mist, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> path unwinds,
    With youthful steps, I’ll trace <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">lines</span>.
    Now I stand, <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> soul alight,

                via songgenerator.io, with styles: &quot;ethereal, male voice,
                asian, ancient, meditation&quot;. ```markdown Verse 1: For
                decades I’ve wandered, seeking the truth, Through trials and
                questions, from my youth. The answers hide, like shadows in the
                night, My heart restless, never in sight. In the silence of the
                mountains, the world fades away, But inside, the turmoil refuses
                to sway.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Chorus: Is it all just the fire of desire, Burning within like a
            raging pyre? As the years pass, the storm calms down, But the quest
            for peace still makes me frown. If all is just driven by the flames
            we know, Then what’s the path to where the wise go?
        </p>
        <p>
            Verse 2: Wild thoughts crash like a beast untamed, Like a tiger
            stalking, never named. As a monk, they see wisdom in my eyes, But
            they don’t know, it’s all a guise. Decades gone, how can I turn
            back? Decades gone, how to ease the lack? They come to me, seeking
            light and peace, But inside, my turmoil will not cease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chorus: If all they want is a comforting lie, Is it mercy to not let
            them cry? Though the truth in me is dark and cold, I dare not speak
            what can’t be told. The rock inside, it cuts like ice, Growing
            harder, no warmth, no light.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bridge: As the years pass by, my silence grows, A burden heavy, that
            no one knows. I’m the monk they seek for hope and grace, But the
            truth I bear, I can’t embrace. If I speak, the world might shatter,
            So I keep the lie, does it even matter?

      ```markdown
      Verse <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
    We left <span class="hljs-keyword">behind</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> city’s rush, <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> shadows steal <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> light,
    Found refuge <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> a quiet shore, <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">day</span> turns <span class="hljs-keyword">into</span> night.
    My brother’s heart weighed down, we sought a place <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> mend,
    In <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> gentle breath <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> island winds, our burdens start <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> bend.

    Verse <span class="hljs-number">2</span>:
    Each <span class="hljs-built_in">day</span> we walked familiar paths, <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> nothing seemed <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> change,
    The sands, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> sea, they stayed <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> same, yet felt a bit more strange.
    The world so small, <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> so slow, <span class="hljs-keyword">until</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> fateful hour,
    When <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> sky began <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> whisper low, revealing all <span class="hljs-keyword">its</span> power.

    Chorus:
    Sky <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> fire, hearts unfold,
    Sunset whispers, secrets told.
    Colors crash, <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> twilight’s call,
    In <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> light, we stood <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> awe.

    Verse <span class="hljs-number">3</span>:
    In <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> glow, we found a peace, <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">words</span> could never <span class="hljs-built_in">name</span>,
    The sky, <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> painted life anew, <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">every</span> shifting flame.
    We walked along <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> golden path, no need <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">words</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> speak,
    For <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> sunset’s warm embrace, our hearts found <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> key <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> unlock <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span> all.

    Chorus:
    Sky <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> fire, hearts unfold,
    Sunset whispers, secrets told.
    Colors crash, <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> twilight’s call,
    In <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> light, we stood <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> awe.

        <ul>
            <li>
                via suno.com, with styles: &quot;Raw, gritty 1980s rock with
                electric guitars, heavy drums, and passionate male vocals, raw
                energy, intense riffs&quot;. ```markdown Verse 1:
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Threads of time, spreading where they flow, Dots we trace, unsure
            where they’ll go. Every choice, a shadow in the glow, But trust the
            journey, let the meaning grow.
        </p>
        <p>Chorus:</p>
        <p>
            In the dance of fate, we find our flow, In shadows cast, the dots
            will show. Each step we take, a seed we sow, In the end, what’s left
            to show?
        </p>
        <p>Verse 2:</p>
        <p>
            Follow echoes where the winds may blow, Through the night, where
            hidden dots lie low. In every scar, a story starts to grow, And in
            the quiet, all the dots will show.
        </p>
        <p>Bridge:</p>
        <p>
            As twilight dims, the final dots will glow, Questions rise: which
            path was worth the throw? When the curtain falls, and the answers
            slow, Will the road you walked, connect the dots you know?
        </p>
        <p>Chorus (Reprise):</p>
        <p>
            In the dance of fate, we find our flow, In shadows cast, the dots
            will show. Each step we take, a seed we sow, In the end, what’s left
            to show?

    “He whispered low, ’You did some good,

    He offered <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> gift, <span class="hljs-keyword">a</span> twist <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> fate,
